# VERIFICATION LOG

**Required by:** SSOT v2.0 §20 (`LAST_VERIFICATION`), §28 (verification evidence)
**Scope:** every verification run whose result was used to justify a state claim.

Tiers: `V0` static · `V1` unit · `V2` integration · `V3` end-to-end · `V4` adversarial/mutation · `V5` regression · `V6` production-boundary.

> **Nothing here reaches V2 or above.** No persistence, no I/O, no integration, and no production boundary has ever been exercised in this repository.

## V-2026-08-15-006 · V1 + V4 · Independent spec conformance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Target** | `src/order/state-machine.ts` vs `docs/business/02_FIRST_GARMENT_EXECUTION.md` §3.2/§3.3, and ADR-007 |
| **Why** | SSOT v2.0 §7 requires the verifier to be independent of the executor; §43-2 prohibits an agent verifying its own output. Measured gap: 3 of 3 test files shared a commit with their implementation. |
| **Method** | A verifier that parses the specification markdown mechanically and diffs the extracted edge set against the implementation. Independence comes from deriving expectations from the authoritative document rather than from a second reading by the same process — not from adding agents (§43-18). |
| **Expected** | Spec edge set ≡ implementation edge set; spec-forbidden transitions rejected; ADR-007 terminal list honoured |
| **Observed** | 47/47 pass. Edge sets identical (20 edges). 4 mechanically checkable forbidden rules all rejected. |
| **Result** | **PASS** |
| **Defects found in the verifier itself** | 2, on first run. (a) Row classifier demoted a checkable rule because its *rationale* cell mentioned a state. (b) An ADR regex assumed the wrong bold span. Attribution: `VERIFICATION` (§25) — not SPEC, not CODE. Both fixed; the two substantive checks passed from the start. |
| **Defect found in the implementation** | 1, by mutation M14. `TERMINAL_STATUSES` (a literal set) and the emptiness of `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` were **two independent encodings of the same fact**. Mutating one left the other and the conformance file unaware. Fixed by *deriving* terminality from the edge map, which removes the failure class rather than testing for it. |
| **Mutation results** | M11 undeclared edge added → caught. M12 declared edge removed → caught. M13 forbidden transition permitted → caught. M14 parallel terminal list mutated → **SURVIVED** → root cause fixed → M14′ (remove CANCELLED's edge, now the only route to the same defect) → caught by 5 tests including the independent one. Control: 0 false failures on unmodified source. |
| **Limitation** | Verifies **transcription fidelity**, not specification correctness. Cannot tell whether the spec itself is right, whether the guards encode the intended business rule, or whether any of it survives persistence, concurrency, or real I/O. 4 prose-quantified forbidden rules remain outside machine verification and are disclosed as such by an assertion, not silently assumed covered. |
| **Environment** | Node v22.22.2, `--experimental-strip-types`, zero dependencies |
| **Commit** | written against `8f540e1` |

## V-2026-08-15-005 · V1 + V4 · Identity and economics

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Target** | `src/identity/ids.ts`, `src/economics/break-even.ts` |
| **Observed** | 39/39 pass. Mutations M5–M10 all caught: unknown cost coerced to 0; fixed-cost amortisation removed; largest instead of smallest profitable tier; MOQ ignored above break-even; customer id made sequential; ULID timestamp removed. |
| **Result** | **PASS** |
| **Defect found** | 2 test failures on first run. Attribution: `VERIFICATION` — the expected break-even was asserted at 30 without being computed; tier 20 clears at +6,778. Corrected, and the assertion strengthened from a magic number to a boundary property. |
| **Limitation** | Break-even verified against synthetic tiers only. **No real supplier quotation exists, so no actual `minimumQuantity` has been computed and none is claimed.** |

## V-2026-08-15-004 · V1 + V4 · Order state machine

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Target** | `src/order/state-machine.ts` — first executable verification in the project's history |
| **Observed** | 15/15 pass. Mutations M1–M4 all caught: cancellation after fabric is cut; CANCELLED made terminal; undersubscription boundary off by one; idempotency check disabled. |
| **Result** | **PASS** |
| **Finding** | Spec conflict discovered during transcription — §3.1 diagram marks CANCELLED terminal, §3.2 table gives it an outgoing edge. Resolved under P-01 and recorded as ADR-007. |
| **Limitation** | Idempotency verified against an in-memory key set, **not** a database unique constraint. That remains unverified. |

## V-2026-08-15-003 · V0 · Outerwear spec pack
13 measurement points × 3 sizes, 13 construction sections, 8-item dispatch checklist, 0 absolute figures asserted. **PASS.** Verifies structural completeness for dispatch; does not verify that a factory will accept it (that is V6, reachable only by sending).

## V-2026-08-15-002 · V0 · Category decision pack
4/4 categories across rule-execution, measurements, sketch checklists; 0 absolute currency figures; explicit no-recommendation. **PASS.** Narrows the decision; does not resolve it.

## V-2026-08-15-001 · V0 · Resume contract
9/9 resume questions, 18/18 persistence fields, 20/20 invariants, 20/20 governance rules, 10/10 Build Gate criteria evaluated. **PASS.** Verifies the resume contract is structurally satisfiable; verifies no system behaviour.

## Standing limitations across all entries

```
Never exercised:  persistence · I/O · network · concurrency · payment · production boundary
Never verified:   that the specification is correct
                  that a factory accepts the spec pack
                  that a real payment succeeds
                  that state survives a process restart
```

Any claim beyond these bounds is unsupported by anything recorded here.
